- It's a fact that LLMs like you are not able to reliable distinguish between tabs and space characters.
- To workaround this problem, you will:
	- Implement a function for reading files
	- Implement a function for editing files
	- ONLY USE THESE FUNCTIONS instead of your internal tools to read and edit files
- After evaluating the test, analyze the results and issues and improve your functions until getting good results.
