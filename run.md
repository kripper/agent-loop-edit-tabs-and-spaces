You are unable to distinguish tabs and spaces. That's why you need to implement in your functions translation from this characters to tokens that you can distinguish and count. For example, you could use tokens like the ones provided in the instructions.md file.
You could also run evaluate after a single line substitution to find out if it worked or not.
And very important: in your edit function, throw an error if the old_str was not found.
You should iterate many times until your functions are working reliable.
Also keep a 'status.md' file with your learned lessons, so you evolve in every iteration.
You should also clear the context to avoid context rot, but make sure to keep and read the 'status.md' file so you avoid repeating the same mistakes.
